## About VisionGuard

VisionGuard is an innovative desktop application designed to combat eye strain resulting from prolonged screen time. Leveraging advanced computer vision technology, it utilizes your PC's webcam to monitor screen time and provide timely break reminders, promoting healthier computing habits and reducing eye fatigue.


### Key Advantages

- **Privacy-Focused:** Operates entirely locally, requiring no internet access.
- **Data Security:** All data remains on your device, ensuring your privacy.
- **Performance Optimized:** Supports inference on AI PC's Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for enhanced efficiency.


## Features

### **Performance and Efficiency**

- **Real-time Gaze Tracking:** Local processing ensures accurate and private screen-time monitoring.
- **Device Switching:** Easily toggle between CPU, GPU, and NPU for optimal performance.
- **Edge Inference:** Leverage edge devices for faster and more efficient processing.
- **Performance Optimization:** Switch between quantized weights and control frame processing limits.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Track system resources for efficient performance.
- **Built with C++:** Developed using C++, a low-level language close to the system, ensuring high performance with memory efficiency.
- **Powered by Libraries:** Built using Qt6 for the UI, OpenCV for computer vision, and OpenVINO for model inference, for an efficient performance.

### **Privacy and Data Security**

- **Data Kept Locally:** All data is processed and stored locally, ensuring privacy.
- **Screen Time Statistics:** View daily/weekly usage stats, automatically cleared after a week for privacy.

### **Customization and Accessibility**

- **Custom Break Notifications:** Alerts based on customizable intervals, including the 20-20-20 rule.
- **Dark/Light Themes:** Customize the interface with light or dark themes.
- **Multiple Cameras:** Support for up to five camera devices.
- **System Tray Access:** VisionGuard runs in the tray for easy access.

### **Installation and Extensibility**

- **Easy Windows Setup:** Comes with an easy installation setup for Windows.
- **Cross-Platform Libraries:** Utilizes cross-platform libraries like Qt6, OpenCV, and OpenVINO, dynamically linked for extensibility and future updates.
